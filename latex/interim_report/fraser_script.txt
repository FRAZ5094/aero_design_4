In order to maximize the amount of retardant the airplane can carry, it is beneficial to removed unnecessary weight now that the plane is no longer a commercial aircraft.
Some of the items that are now unnecessary due to the conversion are passenger seats, the kitchen and the cabin bins.
A consequence of removing all this excess weight is that the center of gravity position of the plane will move.
It is important to know where this new center of gravity position is to ensure that plane can fly safely before, during and after the ejection of retardant.
The safe range for the RJ100 aircraft for the center of gravity along the x axis of the plane is between 28% and 44% of the meal aerodynamic chord.
